# Feature definition

This tables presents the definition of all the stock features provided with musiF.

The first column are Python Regular Expression that match the relevant columns of the
final DataFrame.

The _Kind of values_ column is mainly referred to the Didone DataFrames and its aim is
to give an idea of the range of values that are produced by each feature.

Finally, the _Sock module_ column list the module distributed in musiF and that generates each feature.
